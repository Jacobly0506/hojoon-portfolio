# The final data story

ShortHand: [Too Close, Too Quiet: A Data Story on Suicide in the U.S.](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/unheard-crisis/index.html)

This story uses national suicide case data from 2000–2024 to guide the audience through five key aspects of the crisis: long-term trends, demographic disparities, the most common methods, the mismatch between mental illness and treatment access, and geographic gaps. The goal was to make these patterns feel personal, especially for young adults who may not realize how close to home this issue hits. Visuals are intentionally simple but emotionally resonant, with each chart paired to a specific insight and narrative cue. Rather than altering the graphs themselves, I reworked the surrounding text and structure to make the story more aligned with a meaningful, action-oriented conclusion. The final design elevates both awareness and action by encouraging the audience to reflect, share, and support mental health visibility.

## Content Warning

This project includes data and visualizations related to suicide cases. Some content may be sensitive or triggering. Viewer discretion is advised.

# Changes made since Part II

Since completing Part II, I focused on transforming my visualizations into a cohesive story with stronger flow and emotional clarity. One of the major improvements came after Professor Goranson’s feedback that the story needed a clearer audience and goal. I revised the introduction and added a strong call-to-action at the end focused on public awareness. Bryan also suggested making the Shorthand story more visible and cleanly presented, so I redesigned the layout and confirmed the public link worked.

Through additional user feedback and research, I reframed the CTA to align more directly with public awareness and engagement rather than policy or technical reform. The CTA section was redesigned to feel like a standalone prompt for the reader to act. I also added a clear content warning slide before Section 1, and refined the language around methods of suicide to ensure the focus stayed on prevention and design relevance, not graphic detail. Narrative transitions were improved to ensure the reader is not just informed, but gradually led to a conclusion that feels actionable and relevant.

## The audience

My primary audience is young adults and graduate-level readers, especially those navigating early adulthood where identity shifts and mental health risks are common. During user interviews, I found that students in their 20s and early 30s were often surprised to learn how heavily their age group was represented in the suicide data.

This insight helped me narrow the story’s tone, one that balances emotional sensitivity with data credibility. I also realized the importance of inclusive language, especially when discussing non-binary groups and stigma around seeking help. Small copy edits, accessible color palettes, and clear section transitions were all added with this audience in mind.

## Final design decisions

In refining the CTA and connecting it more clearly to the visual story, I also adjusted the section headers and explanatory captions to reflect a more active tone. For example, I simplified the language around Graph 4 to highlight the tension between mental illness and treatment access, and reframed Graph 5 to lead more naturally into the geographic urgency discussed in the CTA. Rather than expanding the number of visualizations, I worked to strengthen the connective tissue — ensuring that each visual supported the next in a logical progression toward audience action.

In response to feedback from Bryan, I made sure each section had an intentional flow, visually and narratively. I reduced text block sizes and broke longer paragraphs into digestible story beats. I didn’t change the visuals, but made sure the call-to-action was visually distinct and emotionally aligned — encouraging real, tangible public engagement. Professor Goranson noted that the story could feel too broad, so I anchored the conclusion around public understanding and awareness, instead of attempting to solve the entire systemic problem. Design-wise, I kept transitions subtle and seamless, to let the emotional tone carry weight without overwhelming the reader.

# Final thoughts

<p align="center" style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Your awareness could save a life</strong></p>

This project challenged me not just as a data analyst but as a storyteller. Balancing emotional weight with statistical rigor was difficult, especially when dealing with sensitive topics like suicide. I learned how essential it is to build a structured narrative with empathy — the data needs clarity, but the message needs care.

Initially, I assumed the charts could speak for themselves, but user interviews and feedback made it clear that emotional framing and context were necessary. Storytelling helped turn raw data into insight, and insight into reflection. Creating a clear call-to-action was critical, which is a bridge between awareness and engagement.

If I had more time, I would have explored subgroup trends (e.g., race, region) and sourced additional public policy data to connect suicide trends to legislative action — making the story more compelling for policymakers as well as the public. I also would have tested how different audiences, particularly educators and healthcare workers, responded to the same story, to better tailor both message and tone. I also would have refined the visual experience further through annotations and animated transitions that guide interpretation with more ease.

One area I hoped to explore further was how the patterns in this data reflect systemic differences in mental health access and policy. Suicide trends across states likely overlap with Medicaid coverage gaps, provider shortages, or underfunded community services. Highlighting those links would help shift the narrative from awareness to policy-driven action.

Still, I am proud of the final outcome. Even a single dataset, when framed intentionally, can reveal a deeply human story. This project reinforced for me that the most powerful data storytelling happens when we stop asking only “What does this chart show?” and begin asking, “Why does it matter — and what can we do about it?”
