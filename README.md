### Description
In my final redesign, I wanted to shift the focus from the detailed year by year trends shown in the heatmap to a broader, more accessible story using a geographic approach. I created a world map visualization that displays the average general government debt ratio from 1995 to 2019 for each OECD country. My goal was to simplify the data and make it easier for viewers to quickly identify which countries have consistently maintained high or low debt levels over the 25 years of period. Using a red color scale - ranging from light pink for low debt to dark red for high debt. Also, on my map, I highlighted key outliers such as Japan, Greece, and Italy. I think, this design choice made regional patterns more visible and gave the data a global context that was less apparent in the heatmap. Compared to the highlight table in Part 2, I personally think that the heatmap, while rich in detail, can be overwhelming without context. Therefore, the redesigned map is more effective for a general audience or executive - level presentation. The redesigned map reduces complexity, delivers a visual takeaway, and it better suited for executive summaries or general public consumption. 

## Assignment 2: Critique and redesign (MakeoverMonday)

### Step 1: Choose a Data Visualization from MakeoverMonday
For this assignment, I selected the dataset and original visualization from the MakeoverMonday Week 47 (2022) challenge: **Railroad Infrastructure Quality Rankings**.

- **Dataset Source**: [MakeoverMonday 2022 Week 47 – Railroad Infrastructure Quality Rankings](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2022w47)
- **Original Source Organization**: World Economic Forum (via The Global Competitiveness Report)
- **Data Year**: 2019

### Step 2: Critique the data visualization

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1743544016656' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Railroad Infrastructure Quality Rankings (2019) ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;RailroadInfrastructureQualityRankings2019Original&#47;Original&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='RailroadInfrastructureQualityRankings2019Original&#47;Original' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;RailroadInfrastructureQualityRankings2019Original&#47;Original&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div><script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1743544016656');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);</script>

#### Rate each specialty in the original data visualization:

| Criterion        | Score (1–10) | Rationale |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Usefulness**   | 7           | The visualization serves a basic comparative function, ranking countries by railroad quality. However, without context or definition of the metric, its practical value is limited — especially for professional decision-makers. |
| **Completeness** | 5           | The chart lacks critical information such as the year, data source, and methodology. Viewers don’t know what the scores actually mean, reducing its ability to support informed interpretation. |
| **Perceptibility** | 7         | The horizontal bar chart is perceptually effective — bar length is easy to compare, and the descending sort helps with ranking tasks. However, all bars are the same color and not grouped, which reduces clarity of regional patterns. |
| **Truthfulness** | 6           | While the values are likely accurate, the missing context and scale definition undermine validity. The visualization may be unintentionally misleading by omitting key information. |
| **Intuitiveness** | 8          | The design is familiar and easy to understand for most users. No instructions are needed, which supports Few’s principle of intuitive design. |
| **Aesthetics**    | 6          | The design is clean but too minimal. There's little visual hierarchy, no use of color to distinguish insights, and no storytelling element to capture interest. |
| **Engagement**    | 5          | The chart is functional but not memorable. It doesn't encourage further exploration or deeper inquiry. There's no narrative hook or call to action. |

#### Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn’t work well?
The original visualization uses a horizontal bar chart to rank countries by railroad infrastructure quality. This approach works well for comparing values and makes use of perceptually effective encoding. However, it lacks key contextual details — it’s unclear what the score represents, there’s no mention of the year, data source, or how the values were calculated. The design is minimal and does not include color or visual cues to guide the viewer. It is functional, but not insightful. The viewer must do all of the interpretive work themselves.

#### Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?
The main audience likely includes transportation policy professionals, infrastructure analysts, and people interested in global development. It may also be viewed by general audiences. While the design is simple and easy to understand, it does not provide enough information or context for professional use. It lacks transparency and depth, which limits its effectiveness for those who need to make data-informed decisions.

#### Based on your critique, what do you think you’ll try to focus on in your redesign? Any ideas or inspiration for how you can make a better data visualization? What are you excited to try next?
In my redesign, I will focus on making the score more understandable by clearly labeling what it represents, including the year and data source, and formatting values as percentages to indicate comparability. I will use a choropleth map to show spatial distribution and help the audience identify regional patterns. I’ll also use a diverging color scale with a midpoint at 50% to distinguish higher- and lower-scoring countries. I’m excited to apply what we’ve learned about critique-by-design and Stephen Few’s principles to create a clearer and more engaging final visualization.

### Step 3: Sketch out a solution

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1743544864280' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Railroad Infrastructure Quality Rankings (2019) ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;RailroadInfrastructureQualityRankings2019EarlyDraft&#47;Original&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='RailroadInfrastructureQualityRankings2019EarlyDraft&#47;Original' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ra&#47;RailroadInfrastructureQualityRankings2019EarlyDraft&#47;Original&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div> <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1743544864280');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);</script>

To begin designing a solution, I explored alternatives to the original bar chart. I created a few early drafts in Tableau to test different ways of presenting the railroad infrastructure quality data more clearly.

In the original version, the bar chart showed raw scores ranging from 4.1 to 6.8, but it lacked context, visual hierarchy, and deeper engagement. It also used a single flat color and didn’t indicate how the score related to a broader range.

In my early redesign draft, I made two key changes:

- I normalized the data into percentages to make comparisons more intuitive.
- I applied a color scale based on the quality score, helping viewers quickly identify countries with higher or lower scores.

These changes are an attempt to improve:

- Truthfulness (by showing scale and percent context)
- Aesthetics (with color gradients)
- Completeness (with better labeling and interpretation support)

While this draft is still bar-based, it already provides more context than the original chart and moves toward more engaging storytelling. For my next step, I plan to shift from bar charts to a choropleth map in Tableau to show geographic patterns.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
