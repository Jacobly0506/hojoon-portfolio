# What I hope to learn
In this course, I aim to enforce my data visualization skills and enhance my ability to present insights effectively. 
Specifically, I hope to learn:

1. The most commonly used visualization types in industries such as finance, healthcare, and technology.
2. How to choose the right type of visualization based on the dataset and audience.
3. Advanced visualization techniques for handling complex or multidimensional data.
4. Best practices for making visualizations clear, engaging, and insightful.
  
Looking forward to gaining hands-on experience and building a portfolio of data-driven projects :)

#Description
In my final redesign, I wanted to shift the focus from the detailed year by year trends shown in the heatmap to a broader, more accessible story using a geographic approach. I created a world map visualization that displays the average general government debt ratio from 1995 to 2019 for each OECD country. My goal was to simplify the data and make it easier for viewers to quickly identify which countries have consistently maintained high or low debt levels over the 25 years of period. Using a red color scale - ranging from light pink for low debt to dark red for high debt. Also, on my map, I highlighted key outliers such as Japan, Greece, and Italy. I think, this design choice made regional patterns more visible and gave the data a global context that was less apparent in the heatmap. Compared to the highlight table in Part 2, I personally think that the heatmap, while rich in detail, can be overwhelming without context. Therefore, the redesigned map is more effective for a general audience or executive - level presentation. The redesigned map reduces complexity, delivers a visual takeaway, and it better suited for executive summaries or general public consumption.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
