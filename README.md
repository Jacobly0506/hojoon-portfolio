# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi, my name is Hojoon Lee. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University with a concentration in IT Management. My interests lie in data analytics, cybersecurity, and distributed systems. I have experience working as an IT Assistant at Temple University, Transportation Data Scientist at Jiseong Aluminum, Co.Ltd, and Research Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University, and I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I aim to enforce my data visualization skills and enhance my ability to present insights effectively. 
Specifically, I hope to learn:

1. The most commonly used visualization types in industries such as finance, healthcare, and technology.
2. How to choose the right type of visualization based on the dataset and audience.
3. Advanced visualization techniques for handling complex or multidimensional data.
4. Best practices for making visualizations clear, engaging, and insightful.
  
Looking forward to gaining hands-on experience and building a portfolio of data-driven projects :)
