# A Closer Look at Suicide in the United States: A Data-Driven Mental Health Story

## High-Level Summary

Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and a critical indicator of national mental health. This project explores suicide case data across the U.S., uncovering patterns by state, gender, age group, and year. Through interactive data visualizations, this project aims to raise awareness of mental health challenges and tell a responsible, thoughtful story about who is most at riskâ€”and where support may be needed most.

Using maps, charts, and demographic breakdowns, the project will explore how suicide rates vary regionally and whether any clear trends emerge over time. This work will be presented with care, including appropriate content warnings, and will be focused on encouraging data-informed discussions about public health.

## Content Warning

This project includes data and visualizations related to suicide cases. Some content may be sensitive or triggering. Viewer discretion is advised.

## Project Structure

This project analyzes suicide case data across U.S. states and demographic groups to explore underlying patterns and disparities.

## User Story

As a reader, I want to understand how suicide cases vary across the United States by age, gender, and location, so that I can better grasp where and among whom the crisis is most severe.

## Story Arc:

1. The Setting
   - Introduction to suicide as a serious public health issue in the U.S.
   - Brief overview of rising concern about mental health over recent years

2. The Rising Action
   - Overview map of suicide cases by U.S. state
   - Year-by-year breakdown to show trends over time
   - Gender-based comparisons

3. The Climax
   - Dive into age-specific and gender-specific suicide data
   - Use heatmaps and bar charts to show high-risk groups
   - Highlight patterns in certain regions or age brackets

4. The Falling Action
   - Interpret key findings: which regions or age groups show concerning trends
   - Discuss possible factors (e.g., socioeconomic, access to mental health care, rural vs. urban differences)
   - Introduce voices or policies that respond to the data (if applicable)

5. The Conclusion
   - Reflect on the broader implications for public health
   - Emphasize the importance of continued awareness and preventive action
   - Note dataset limitations and encourage responsible data interpretation

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.  

## The data

The Data
This project uses a publicly available dataset from data.world, which includes detailed suicide case data across the U.S.

Each row in the dataset contains attributes such as:
- State
- Gender
- Age Group
- Year
- Number of Cases

These variables allow for a comprehensive breakdown of trends by region and demographic. I will clean and transform the data using Excel, and build visualizations in Tableau to guide readers through the story.

The dataset will serve as the foundation for all visualizations in this project. It will be used to map the physical locations of stores across the world map, enabling visual storytelling through heatmaps and clustering diagrams. The latitude and longitude fields will allow me to create interactive maps in Tableau Public, while the country and city fields will be used to count and compare store distribution by region.

|------|-----|-------------|
|Suicide Cases in the United States|[Suicide Cases in the United States](https://data.world/guy-govt/suicide-cases-in-the-united-states))|Includes yearly suicide case counts broken down by state, gender, and age group|

## Method and medium

Visualizations will be created using Tableau Public, and the final story will be published using Shorthand.

Planned visuals include:

- Choropleth maps of suicide cases by state
- Bar charts comparing age and gender groups
- Time series charts showing changes over years
- Heatmaps highlighting high-risk age-state combinations

The narrative will follow a linear structure, embedding these visuals within a guided scrollable story on Shorthand.
