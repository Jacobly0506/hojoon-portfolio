# Mapping the Global Footprint of Starbucks: <br/>How a Coffee Chain Spreads Across Cities and Countries

## High-Level Summary

Starbucks has become one of the most recognized global brands, with thousands of stores spread across continents. However, its expansion strategy varies widely across countries and cities. This project explores the geographic footprint of Starbucks locations around the world, using data visualization to highlight where stores are concentrated, how cities are saturated, and how the company adapts its store density to urban layout, consumer demand, and regional strategies.

By examining the spatial distribution of Starbucks stores using interactive maps and charts, the project aims to tell a story about globalization, urbanization, and retail strategy. Readers will gain insight into where and how Starbucks chooses to scale its operations — from dense clusters in major cities like Tokyo or New York, to sparse placement in newer markets. The project will also explore how opening hours differ across locations and whether patterns emerge based on geography or culture.

## Project Structure

This project maps Starbucks store locations globally to explore how store density and distribution reflect regional business strategies and urban development.

## User Story

As a reader, I want to understand where Starbucks stores are located globally, so that I can better grasp the company’s international expansion patterns and how they relate to geography and culture.

## Story Arc:

1. The Setting
   - Introduction to Starbucks as a global brand
   - Brief history of its expansion and presence in 80+ countries

2. The Rising Action
   - Overview map showing global distribution
   - Bar chart ranking countries by total number of Starbucks locations
   - Highlight regional differences in store counts

3. The Climax
   - Get deeper into top cities (e.g. New York, Seoul, Tokyo)
   - Use city-level maps to show clustering and density
   - Explore whether location patterns align with transportation hubs, tourist zones, or population centers

4. The Resolution
   - Identify gaps: where is Starbucks not found?
   - Reflect on what store distribution patterns say about globalization and urban development
   - Conclude with implications for future growth

## The data

This project uses a publicly available dataset from data.world, which contains the geographic and descriptive information for over 13,000 Starbucks store locations around the world. The dataset includes key attributes such as... 
- Store name,
- Street address,
- City,
- State,
- Country,
- Latitude,
- Longitude,
- Opening hours,
- Limited contact information
Each row represents a single Starbucks store, making the dataset ideal for spatial analysis and global comparisons.

The dataset will serve as the foundation for all visualizations in this project. It will be used to map the physical locations of stores across the world map, enabling visual storytelling through heatmaps and clustering diagrams. The latitude and longitude fields will allow me to create interactive maps in Tableau Public, while the country and city fields will be used to count and compare store distribution by region. Additionally, I may explore the opening hours field to assess regional differences in operating times, and use this to tell a deeper story about how Starbucks adapts to local culture and consumer behavior. All data cleaning and preparation will be done using Excel before importing into Tableau for visualization.
